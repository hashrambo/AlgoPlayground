 * Leetcode 53 - Maximum SubArray
 * Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
 * For example, given the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4],
 * the contiguous subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6

     * max subarray is a dp problem. The solution is to break it down to subproblem first.
     * So this array has i elements. The point is to keep track of the maximum so far for 1... i-1 element.
     * The algorithm works like this. First we have two variables for tracking purposes. One is to keep track
     * of the maximum for the previously added sum to the current element. The other one is to keep track of
     * the maximum for the maximum so far with the max value from previous iteration with the previous tracking
     * variable, that is the max of the sum with the added current element in this iteration.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(n)
     * @param nums
     * @return
